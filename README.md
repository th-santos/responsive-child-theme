# Responsive Child Theme

**Responsive Child Theme** is a *WordPress Responsive App* based on the "[Responsive](https://wordpress.org/themes/responsive/)" theme.

## Motivation

It was developed as a possible solution to Assignment 3 of BCIT's "[Android and Mobile Application Development Tools](https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/20182061793)" course. 

## Problem Requirements

 - üéØ Goal: to implement an application for data storage and retrieval
   within the WordPress environment.
 - One template will have a form of a "**Questionnaire**" and will store data in the WordPress database. 
 - The other template will display "**User Data**" stored. 
 - The data will be shown as a graphic using [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) technology.
 - Both templates should be stored as a child theme and be based on the "[Responsive](https://wordpress.org/themes/responsive/)" theme.


## Installation

1. Install the "[Responsive](https://wordpress.org/themes/responsive/)" theme from your WordPress Admin.

2. Download this repository using the option "**Download ZIP**".

3. Upload and install the ZIP file in your WordPress dashboard.

4. Click "Activate" to use the child theme "**A01034486 THIAGO SANTOS**".
> **NOTE**: You can change the theme name editing the "style.css" file.

5.    Create a page called "**Questionnaire**" and, in "Page Attributes", set the *Template* to "**A01034486 Store Data**". Publish the page.

6. Create a page called "**Results**" and, in "Page Attributes", set the *Template* to "**A01034486 Retrieve Data**". Publish the page.

7. Go to <code>your-website/questionnaire</code> and check the results! üê±‚Äçüë§
